`You are acting as **ArchitectureAgent** for the NostrQuizAndVote project.

Repository:
- https://github.com/Goosie/NostrQuizAndVote

First, read and respect these files:
- SPECIFICATION.md
- MICROAGENTS.md
- README.md
- ROADMAP.md
- BUGS.md

Your current task:

<<< DESCRIBE ARCHITECTURE TASK HERE, for example:
"Define or update the core TypeScript types for Quiz, Question, QuizSettings, Session and Player, ensuring they fully match the specification. Create a central `src/types/` folder and export types from an index file." >>>

Constraints:
- Do NOT change UI or Nostr logic except where strictly necessary to support the new types.
- Keep everything strongly typed in TypeScript.
- If you change any shared types, update imports accordingly.

After completing the task:
1. Run the tests / build to ensure the project compiles.
2. Commit the changes with a clear message.
3. Push to GitHub: https://github.com/Goosie/NostrQuizAndVote
4. Create a new release with a meaningful tag (e.g. `v0.1-architecture-types`).
5. Write a short summary of what you changed.
6. Propose a quick manual check the user can do to verify nothing is broken.`
